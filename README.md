# SmartHomePromo

Here is a smart home app allowing people to control intercoms of their houses. This project is presented as part of my portfolio, it was created on my own for one smart home products company. It was a bit modified not to violate any copyrignts.  HTTP request links were also removed. But anyway you can deploy it, but first you will need to install Pods.

Also on your demand I can provide a workflow screen recording.

Thank you
